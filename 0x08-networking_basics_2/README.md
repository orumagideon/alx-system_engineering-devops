 a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this
 a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.

Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-show_attached_IPs | cat -e
10.0.2.15$
127.0.0.1$
sylvain@ubuntu$
Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.

Note that we can see our localhost IP :)
