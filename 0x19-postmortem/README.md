Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Adventure

Issue Summary:

Duration: 4 hours (14:00 to 18:00, UTC)
Impact: Affecting 30% of users, resulting in slow response times and intermittent service disruptions on our e-commerce platform.
Timeline:

Detection: 14:00 - An alert triggered by our monitoring system indicated increased response times.
Investigation: Our engineer, Bob, noticed the alert and began investigating immediately.
Actions Taken:
Bob investigated the database server, suspecting a bottleneck, but found no issues.
Assumed it might be a network latency problem and started analyzing network logs.
A misleading path was taken when high CPU usage was observed on a web server, leading to unnecessary optimizations.
Escalation: At 15:30, the incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database teams for a collaborative investigation.
Resolution: At 18:00, the root cause was identified and mitigated.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Cause: A rogue SQL query overwhelmed the database server, causing a cascading effect on the web servers.
Resolution: The offending query was optimized, and additional indexes were added to prevent similar incidents. Load balancing was adjusted for better distribution.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements:
Enhanced monitoring for early detection of slow queries.
Code review processes to catch resource-intensive queries before deployment.
Conducting stress tests to simulate heavy traffic scenarios.
Tasks:
Implement a more robust alerting system.
Conduct training sessions on optimizing SQL queries for developers.
Update incident response procedures to streamline communication during outages.
Humor Break:
As we delved into the database abyss, we half-expected to find a rebellious query writing a manifesto. Unfortunately, it was just a poorly optimized piece of code, not a SQL revolutionary.
